Business Problem:
A leading Al consulting firm handles large volumes of technical documents such as regulatory guidelines, compliance manuals, research papers, and operational workflows. These documents are often lengthy and complex, making manual summarization and the creation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) inefficient and Inconsistent. The current manual approach delays the production of structured SOPs and introduces the risk of errors. To enhance operational efficiency and maintain consistency, an automated solution is required to quickly and accurately summarize these documents and generate concise, well-organized SOPs.
